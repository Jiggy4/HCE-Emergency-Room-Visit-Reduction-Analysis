# Project Architecture for Health Care Economics: Emergency Room Visit Reduction Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on reducing the emergency room (ER) visits for Good Health Physicians. Our goal is to reduce the utilization to an annual rate of 450 ER visits per 1000 members within three years. Three strategic options were proposed and analyzed to achieve this target.

## Data Description
- **Features:** Variables related to healthcare access and ER utilization
- **Target Variable:** Reduction in ER visits to meet the annual target of 450 visits per 1000 members

## Technology Stack
- Data Analysis: Excel
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Excel for visual insights into the data distribution and relationships.
- **Models and Analysis:**
  - ROI Analysis for ER Visit Reduction Strategies
  - Correlation Analysis between Food Insecurity and ER Utilization/Average Risk Score

## Intervention Options for ER Visit Reduction
**Option 1: Hiring an Additional Practitioner**
- **Impact:** Reduces ER visits per 1000 to 472.5 in the first year, 448.9 in the second and third years.
- **ROI:** 315.49% in the first year, 463.493% in the second year, 486.73% in the third year.

**Option 2: Building an Additional Urgent Care Center**
- **Impact:** Reduces ER visits to approximately 446 visits per 1000 each year, maintaining this reduction over three years.
- **ROI:** 136.34% in the first year, 141.68% in the second year, 146.19% in the third year.

**Option 3: Adding a New Phone Line Staffed by Triage Nurses**
- **Impact:** Reduces ER visits per 1000 to 472.5 in the first year, 448.9 in the second and third years.
- **ROI:** 576% in the first year, 890.8% in the second year, 924.97% in the third year.

## Key Findings
- **Most Effective Strategy:** The addition of a new phone line staffed by triage nurses was the most cost-effective and had the highest ROI, effectively reducing the ER visits below the target of 450 visits per 1000 by the third year.

- **Comparative Analysis:** While building an urgent care center also achieved target reductions, it did not yield as high a return on investment as the telephonic triage service.

## Recommendations
- **Adopt the Phone Triage Line:** Good Health should implement the phone triage line to ensure effective ER visit reductions while maximizing cost efficiency and improving patient experiences.

## Conclusion
The analysis strongly supports the addition of a triage phone line as the best option to reduce unnecessary ER visits, providing a cost-effective and patient-oriented solution to the challenges faced by Good Health Physicians.
